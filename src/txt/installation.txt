A short guide for how to install and enable your shiny new version of Commit Mono.
This is taken from https://commitmono.com/install

1. (Download the fonts)
2. Unzip the fonts. You'll see 4 font files. These 4 fonts make up a 'Style Group':
   * CommitMono-Regular: Base version with settings and weight of your choice.
   * CommitMono-Italic: An italic version, same weight as regular.
   * CommitMono-Bold: A bold version, weight 700.
   * CommitMono-BoldItalic: A bold version, weight 700, that is also italic.
3. Install all 4 fonts on your system:
   * Windows: Right click the font in the folder and click "Install".
   * Mac: Open fonts with Font Book from the folder and click "Install".
   * Linux: Unpack fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts (or /usr/share/fonts to install
     fonts system-wide) then fc-cache -f -v
4. Restart your editor/IDE.
5. Settings/Preferences → Editor → Font:
   Pick CommitMono from the list. If you're using VS Code, simply put 
   ["editor.fontFamily": "CommitMono"], in the settings.json file.

If you have enabled one or more features/ligatures in your download, these are
available through the 'calt' OpenType Feature. In VS Code this feature can be
enabled using by putting ["editor.fontLigatures": true,] in the settings.json
file. For a comprehensive guide on how to enable in your specific editor/IDE,
refer to Fira Code Wiki:
